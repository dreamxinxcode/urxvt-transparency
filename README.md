# urxvt-transparency
Shell script to toggle urxvt transparency

# Usage
* Make this script executable by running "chmod +x transparency.sh".
* Execute the script by running "./transparency.sh".

# Note
You will need to open a new instance of urxvt for the changes to take effect.

# Optional keybinding
I have this script set to run on a keybind for convenience. I highly recommend doing the same.
